# Optimization Visualizer

## General Idea

We wish to create a visualizer for optimization issues, allowing newer students to understand the concepts of function optimization, landscape traversal and gradient de/ascent with less confusion.

We want to be able to provide visualization of a landscape function within given bounds, done through a point mesh taken at arbitrary intervals. The main focus of the project is to be able to not only visualize the landscape, but the action of optimizers, visualizing the path they take through the iterations.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Simple implementation for 2D optimization issues, with a very simple function and optimizer.
- [ ] Generalize to accept multiple arbitrary optimizers.
- [ ] Generalize to accept arbitrary landscape functions.


### Optional

- [ ] Move implementation to a javascript webpage, allowing interaction (hard).
- [ ] Add option to utilize 3D landscape functions and optimizers.
